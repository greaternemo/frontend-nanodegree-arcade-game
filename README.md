# Not Frogger

The Frogger clone game I made for the third project of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree course.

### Dependencies

There are no software dependencies for this repo.

The intended experience expects a display with a minimum width of 505px and requires a keyboard with standard arrow keys.

There are no other dependencies.

### Installation

Clone the GitHub repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:greaternemo/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git
```
At this point you can rename the directory to whatever you want to use for the URL. The included .htaccess file should work with any URL. 

### How To Play

You control the player character, the girl, with the 4 arrow keys (up, right, down, left).

The object of the game is to walk through the path of the bugs to get to the water. If you make it to the water, you win and you'll be teleported back to the start.

If any of the bugs run into you, you'll also be sent back to the start.
